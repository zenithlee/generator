at the point of payment because the shipping of items in the cart is charged differently if they are not from the same seller which actually increases the cost of the items in the cart.

Also,your dispatch/delivery personnel especially in Portharcourt where I reside, should allow customers inspect the items ordered especially food items to ensure the right order(s) was sent.

My transaction on Konga.com is always smooth, especially with the KongaPay that allows me enjoy some discount.;My last pick up experience was a bit disappointing. This was due to the fact that I purchased the qasa rechargeable fan deal with free kettle. When I went to pick up, I got one kettle for purchasing 2 fans, instead of two  kettles. Tho, I called customer care right there at the KOS centre, I received an email afterwards, so I am expecting to receive that one kettle.    I hope I can still vouch for Konga's integrity. Please, don't let some employee rubbish that.    Regards.;Large Appliances;KWK;Desktop Web

None;Konga should endeavor to apply "What You See Is What You Get - WYSIWYG" on its website. A situation where the item supplied is at variance with what is on the website in terms of description and looks is very discouraging. 100% copy and paste of product description and pictures should be avoided. For example a particular manufacture may produce different variants of the SAME product with corresponding price tags. It is misleading to apply similar description on all of them simply because they are from the same manufacturer, especially when these items are supplied by different vendors.    Some of your vendors use known manufacturers to advertise their products only for them to supply substandard items from fake manufacturers. Your Quality Control Team are not doing well in this area.    Should your require clarifications, please call me.;Fitness;SHQ;Desktop Web

At the point of delivery. my order was already within my city of residence and it still did not get to me for over three days even though my address isn't difficult to locate.;"Delivery guys should be instructed to deliver orders to the addresses filled out online immediately they arrive those destinations.  These guys are not meant to expect customers to place a call to arrange for product pick-up at their stations before thinking of bringing it over. Customers are not daft, if they wanted to pick it up at these stations, they would have indicated it as their address when placing the order online.    Another area of improvement is the area of shipping. When a customer places an order, irrespective of whether the order is meant to be serviced by a single seller or different sellers, related products should be packaged and shipped together to save shipping cost. For instance, shipping a shirt and a trouser; different wristwatches or shipping a phone and its accessories like; earphones, case, etc. separately is unacceptable and seems dumb. These items should be shipped together and a shipping fee charged on that basis.    ";Mobile Phones;SHQ;Desktop Web

Delivery. Konga courier delivery system is very poor. For example, my wife received a notice that our good has left your Ikota office by around 8.10am to our place at Lekki Gardens. Even when we had other places to go, we waited at home till around 2pm before we went out. It was around 3pm that we received a call from the courier when he got to our place. We later informed him to return the item to your Ikota office for us to come the following day (I.e. Friday 08/04/16) to collect it. Despite the fact that we still called on Friday morning to confirm that we will be coming to pick the item at Ikota, we got there only to be told that the item has left again for our place. It was indeed very embarrassing to note that it was the same person that we had been calling and who described your Ikota office at Road 4 to us, that eventually told us that it had again left for delivery. My wife and I had no choice than to abandon the transaction and went to a shop to purchase the item. The same fate is currently befalling the item my wife is trying to purchase on line. ;The challenge has always been how to communicate with Konga or its courier.

This Product is rubbish. First,  the delivery man withdrew 750 twice which I complained about and was told to check my bank. He withdrew 750 because he didn't have a change. The product was 3,750. First transaction he said network issue while the 2nd transaction went through. Only for US to find out both went through. I then called konga till date I've not gotten a refund. Was asked to check my bank which I did I did check my bank and there no refund for one of the transaction. Secondly, the USB that came with this product isn't working. How will a product be sent with a bad USB?  That's what they practically did.  Poor and bad product. I won't shop on konga again. Am very disappointed ;Please always give your delivery men change. If a product is 3750 u should know the buyer can as well give them 4,000. To avoid misap. Give them change.

At point of delivery. Often times you get a text that your item will be delivered then they don't show and you get the 'sorry we couldn't reach you' message but you waited and nobody came. I had an experience in March where the merchant called and I told him that I would be around till 5pm. Then by 4:30 I call him and he says he's fixing his bike. That parcel didn't get to me until another 7 days. And it only happened because I called the Abuja office and expressed my displeasure.;1. Not to compare Konga with Jumia, I konga takes a longer time to deliver. Most times when I need an item in 5 days, I order from Jumia because I am of getting it between 3-5 days. For Konga, 7 days or more is a really long time for delivery within Nigeria.     2. The delivery rate of 1000 per merchant is really expensive. Sometimes I may be buying small items worth 4000 naira from 6 merchants and I end up paying 5000 naira for delivery. It gets rather discouraging.

Why dont Konga combine all the products of my order and deliver once for all. I ordered 4 different items (all small electronic items) and I had to coordinate with 4 different delivery agents and had to be available at my office on 4 different occassion. As a serious professional u would be happy receiving calls every now & then for your personal purpose during office hours.    I got delivery of power bank which I ordered in Konga. But neither did he handover any receipt nor did he collect any acknowledgment for delivery. How does a reputed organisation work like a road side shop?;Your shipping fee has to be looked at. I get all the products from Jumia through their collection point without any delivery charges/nominal at N250 But with you I have to pay N750 for every product. At times the product value and shipping fee used to be the same.     Two solutions   1. Create collection points - which reduces the shipping fee and also the hassle of receiving 10 calls from 10 different people and 10 different time/date of deliveries during office hours.   2. Offer products from the same vendor - If I had selected some product and if the same is available with another vendor whom I had already selected for some other product, a pop up/ message can be shown that this product is available with the 1st vendor hence you can save shipping fee. ;Personal Care;SHQ;Desktop Web

There was an instance when I wanted to order for two items from different sellers; The total cost of the items was about N5,500 and I was to be charged N3,000 for each item , meaning I was supposed to pay N6,000 to ship two items to the same location(specifically, omu-Aran in kwara State)!

There was a day I wanted to shop in your site, so I ordered for a phone, power bank and a book, and when I was checking out I saw  that each of this product were charged with its own delivery fee of 3k. But I ordered them at once, I asked myself. So I cancelled everything. To me it's a total waste of money. Besides supposing I ordered for 5 products each with 10k cost price, that would be 10k  5= 50k. So, the five products with its shipping fee would be 15k.    Therefore, 50k  15k= 65k.

Two instances: you advertise that one gets 2000 naira off when one uses the app for the first time. But that's not entirely true. I had to search around to find that actually one gets 2000 naira BACK after buying and that's only if you spend 20000 or more. Just be up front: tell customers that's what's going to happen otherwise, they'll use the app, not see any deduction and conclude that Konga is fraudulent. Not good for business. Besides,  Jumia gives you an instant 2000 off. 1a. You said this would be a 15 second survey. That's also not true. Even with a fast connection and not answering the last two questions this survey will take longer than 15 secs. Call it the 1-minute survey.  2. The delivery fee of 1500 is criminal. 3. Those who use Kongapay should get priority shipping. We're putting a lot of trust in you by paying up front. Show some more love with priority shipping. The 5% off is a good start though. 4. Do you guys even read these surveys or just waste our time filing them in. If I don't geta response to this, I'm not filling in any more surveys. 5. Please have a reward system for reviewers.

And either pay me my money back, or return a new memory card. This should be done fast, because I am ready to fight for my money through any process that is available for me. I hate anything fraud.

Delivery;I often shop with jumia and what I find satisfactory about there services is they always would reach the customer in advance with details of who will make the delivery and when: this afford the opportunity to plan for time to receive the delivery.  On the contrary,  konga just would call you almost when they want to make delivery and often,  the customer has his day planned and is not available.  I would suggest you inform customers early enough about intended deliveries so they can plan for time to receive it instead of catching us in the middle of my activities. ;Toys & Activities;SHQ;Konga App

At about 1330hrs, he called me that he was on his way to deliver my order. Again he did not come. He called me at about 1700hrs. By this time I was in Church. What I saw on the tracking in the night was "Customer reschedule delivery." This order got to me the following day (23/04/2016) at about 1700hrs. Please check his call log.    Now order number F824055142001 has been with them since yesterday. I got a call from your Dispatch rider (09094537653) at about 1600hrs yesterday (25/04/2016) for delivery. As at the time (1710hrs on 26/04/2016) of completing this survey I am yet to hear from him.  ;Most of your customers in Warri area work in Field locations. Some operate 7/7, 14/14 or 28/28 days work cycle. The orders are usually placed during their time off. Order that has arrived KOS Effurun and is delayed because of lackadaisical attitude of your Dispatch riders may never be delivered.

;I purchased a fake or factory faulted phone from you guys. I spoke to the customer care about this and I was replied later that I should drop the tablet phone(bryte tablet phone-gold), in a place at admiralty in Lagos.    Now this is my issue, how do you guys expect a phone I bought for my daughter that refused to power on only after five 5days of use to still be in thesame condition with the pack and all? My daughter out of excitement has already trashed the pack, personalized her tablet by writing her name on the back of the free case that came with it. And on your return policy that u guys sent to me, u said the phone must be in same shape and condition at purchase or else it won't be accepted. And was also given a max of 24hrs from after the reception of the email to be returned. ...... So what are you saying....this is Lagos.  I work ! And I should make magic under 24hrs to return the phone?????. All these was not considered and no one else from the customer care has tried to inquire if I was satisfied about the transaction since then anymore.  I didn't think that was fair.     Am not saying you guys should take it back like that, but we cld actually come to an agreement like changing the phone without the accessories or giving it to your technician to look if it can be fixed. Am still bittered about this even as I still partronise your market. I will be pleased if you guys can look into this for me. Email: ajumaomalance@yahoo.co.uk. Phone no: 08035053227.

I have challenges ordering the item before the check out window. The point where I had to put in my details (e.g delivery address) as it kept displaying that the item could not be delivered at the specified address. The delivery charge was ridiculous I must say, because it is about 80% of the cost of the item. Secondly I tried registering as a merchant some time back and got discouraged because of lack of communication. I had an issue with my password and got a mail without a link to change it. I sent mails severally asking for a change in password and got no response. I have not had a pleasant experience with Konga I must say and I don't look forward to shopping online at Konga anymore.;I would suggest you give more attention to the items you sell online and ensure the items delivered are exactly as they appear. If there are any deviations or alterations from the original appearance, they should be specified beside the item during purchase so people don't feel they have been deceived into buying something different. Secondly, exceptional customer service sets a company apart from others. This is an area I feel Konga should invest in and train her staff effectively to carry out this function. There is no point having a live chat that doesn't work. Thirdly when the cost of delivery exceeds the cost of an item being bought online, then there is no incentive. Shopping online should be cheaper and convenient. I think Konga should look into the delivery cost critically so she doesn't end up discouraging  her customers from shopping on her platform.;Books;KWK;Desktop Web
Trying to return clothing items. Returns policy not clear for some Sellers. It must be boldly stated that returns aren't possible. Most times the seller is silent on the issue and Konga dosent seem to make it madatory;1) Items need better descriptions/specifications - (a) eg clothing, type of material, care requirements (dryclean? cold wash?), what sizing is being used ie UK or US or something else.  (b) Equipment. Large Items etc - Items with only 1 picture are misleading. Angles are required to get a better  understanding of sizing along with specifications. I bought a cooker and couldnt tell from the picture that the burners were as small as they were when I got my delivery.  (c) Insufficient Descriptions - For quite a few items, specifications weren't sufficient or non - existent. Its difficult to make good decision's with insufficient information. This will cause many more people to return items purchased    (2) After putting an item in your basklet It should be possible to go back to the exact page you stopped on when shopping. Currently you are taken back to the first page of whatever your search group was  (3) Konga has to do a better job of quality checking clothing people put up if that's even possible. There is a lot of poor quality stuff being passed off as what its not  and returns are few and far between on these items.  (4) Theres a section to scroll through similar items being considered usually below whatever item you are looking at. 8 out of 9 items the scroller isn't there for whatever reason and as such you cant take advantage    (5) Comparisons - It would be great if the option of comparing like items was made available. I had to purchase a microwave recently and it was such a tedious task trying to recall or keep tabs on all the specs for the various models I was comparing.  (6) There should be some sort of incentive plan to encourage people to spend time providing quality  reviews on items purchased. Everyone will benefit - konga, the customers, the sellers.    (7) Sellers should not be allowed to cancel an order AFTER it has ben placed becoause they want to raise prices. The only reason this hold be allowed is if they are out of stock and they cannot suddenly "have stock" 2 days or even a few days later at an increased price. It smacks of dishonesty and is a put off;Women's Wear;KWK & SHQ;Desktop Web

My last order was a fridge & the dispatcher refused to let me view the fridge before paying. Which is the reason I returned the order. Also ur charge of 1000 & sometimes 1500 per order is outrageous.

Charging 1000 per item defeats the whole point of ur discounts online. Advise dispatchers to allow costumers view items and ensure they are in working order before they pay.

Four times I have made attempts to purchase phones from Konga and I have had bad experience two times out of the four times. The first time in which I had paid before delivery, I was given the item with different specs from what was advertised. It took write a while to get refund. The second which was today,  I got to find out that the item was defective which was confirmed by the guy that delivered. I didn't pay despite pressure from the customer service that I should pay for a defective item and that it will be replaced for me. For this particular item,  I specified "Sold by Konga".;Stop dealing with sellers who do not have integrity and do not ask your clients to pay for obviously defective items.

  Delays in cash refund. Even as I am writing, its taking konga two months to refund my cash on item not delivered. Which is not very dissatisfactory and annoying.   ;"It would be very wise for KONGA to consider some of the advantages of her competitors like Jumia. Jumia has shipping centres all over the states in Nigeria; taking Delta as a case study. Shipping cost from Lagos to Warri to their centre is fair and also they also accumulate orders i.e If your orders are from different merchant, they accumulate them and give you a shipping rate which was meant to ship one item. But KONGA is far different, For instance if I order a pair of shoe, printer, phone and all from different merchant with same address, say the goods are coming to Delta, the same amount you charge for shipping the shoe applies to the all 3 items which could amount to N9,000 at N3,000 per item but in jumia, N3,000 covers for the three items since they are owned by same person and going to same address. On a nut shell, KONGA should still work on her shipping rate and also create centres which one could have the choice at checkout point to reduce shipping cost. Thanks.

Every time i place an order with konga i have difficulty with your delivery, its either they come with no pos and i have to start looking for cash, or they make me stay home all day waiting for the product. As i speak i have a pending order, i was called on fri saying they were bring the order but i was unavailable, i called afterwards to find out where the guy was so i could see if it was possible to meet up with him smewhere close and collect the item but just ended up being angry, then i was called yesterday morning again to expect the order in two to three hours, stayed home all day and up till now still haven't received it, its almost 24hrs. now i have to stay home again in the hopes that they come today.;Ensure clients are alerted at least 24 hrs to expect their delivery and ensure they get it said time, not every body work a nine to five or are jobless, some people have jobs that require them to move around so they cant be home all day everyday just because they placed an order with konga.;Fragrances;SHQ;Desktop Web

The search field in the Konga app is a huge gap. It's quite hard to make individual searches for items. One has to go through the menu bar for categories and start scrolling through hundreds and thousands of items to find an item of interest. Kindly upgrade search criteria critically;Shipping costs are still too high. And cost of items of the same brand and quality are not only high but vary widely across konga seller. One needs to be able to easily find a seller with the lowest price for an item. The search criteria in terms of brand, sizes, seller, price, etc, does not work most times and doesn't sort properly.;Health;SHQ;Konga App

I received an email about free delivery if I use the coupon code 'JUSTFORME'  however after several attempts, the code didn't work and I had to pay for delivery.

I bought a make up product and I paid with Konga pay. Upon delivery in Bwari, Abuja the delivery man just gave me the item and sped off. I later discovered it not to be of the quality I wanted.

"Usually at delivery; has to meet up with delivery agent at point other than the address given.";I think on the overall, Konga is not doing too badly. However for low price items (0k - 5k), standard delivery rate of 1k is on the high side particularly if item is also light weight. ;Small Appliances;SHQ;Desktop Web
