MY PRETTY ROSE TREE

A flower was offered to me,
    Such a flower as May never bore;
But I said, 'I've a pretty rose tree,'
    And I passed the sweet flower o'er.

Then I went to my pretty rose tree,
    To tend her by day and by night;
But my rose turned away with jealousy,
    And her thorns were my only delight.

THE LITTLE BOY LOST

'Father, father, where are you going?
   O do not walk so fast!
Speak, father, speak to your little boy,
   Or else I shall be lost.'

The night was dark, no father was there,
   The child was wet with dew;
The mire was deep, and the child did weep,
   And away the vapour flew.

THE LILY

The modest Rose puts forth a thorn,
The humble sheep a threat'ning horn:
While the Lily white shall in love delight,
Nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright.

A DREAM

Once a dream did weave a shade
O'er my angel-guarded bed,
That an emmet lost its way
Where on grass methought I lay.

Troubled, wildered, and forlorn,
Dark, benighted, travel-worn,
Over many a tangled spray,
All heart-broke, I heard her say:

'O my children! do they cry,
Do they hear their father sigh?
Now they look abroad to see,
Now return and weep for me.'

Pitying, I dropped a tear:
But I saw a glow-worm near,
Who replied, 'What wailing wight
Calls the watchman of the night?'

'I am set to light the ground,
While the beetle goes his round:
Follow now the beetle's hum;
Little wanderer, hie thee home!'

SPEAK ROUGHLY TO YOUR LITTLE BOY

And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line: 

Speak roughly to your little boy, 
And beat him when he sneezes; 
He only does it to annoy, 
Because he knows it teases." 


CHORUS
(in which the cook and the baby joined): -- -- 

"Wow! wow! wow!" 


While the Duchess sang the second verse of 
the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up 
and down, and the poor little thing howled so, 
that Alice could hardly hear the words: -- -- 

"I speak severely to my boy, 
I beat him when he sneezes; 
For he can thoroughly enjoy 
The pepper when he pleases!" 


CHORUS 

"Wow! wow! wow!"
