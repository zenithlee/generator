It is Meat and Drink to me
Lay it on with a trowel
Lie Low
Like The Dickens
Love is Blind
Makes your hair stand on end
Men's Evil Manners live in brass; their virtues we write in water
Milk of Human Kindness
Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows
More Fool You
More honoured in the breach than in the observance
Much ado about nothing
Mum is The Word
My Salad Days
Neither a borrower nor a lender be
Night Owl
No more cakes and ale?
Now is the winter of our discontent
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Off With His Head
Oh, That Way Madness lies
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more
Out of The Jaws of Death
Pound of Flesh
Primrose Path
Rhyme nor Reason
Salad Days
Sans Teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything
Screw your courage to the sticking place
Send Him Packing
Set One's Teeth on Edge
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Short Shrift
Shuffle Off This Mortal Coil
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep
Some are born great
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark
Star-Crossed Lovers
